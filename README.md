Agentoo is a modular perl irc bot with gentoo features that use POE-Component-IRC module (http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-IRC/) as a client. At this time he has only two modules.
1. Gentoo.pm: Responsible for gentoo features.
2. Talk.pm: Responsible for talk with users.
You can find one instance of Agentoo in the channels #Agentoo or #gentoo-br at freenode.
